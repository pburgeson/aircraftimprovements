# Aircraft Improvements
Development of small, non permanent improvements for my 1965 Piper Cherokee C.  This repo will also act as the documentation source for my aviation related projects.

## History
In December of 2021, I purchased an old Piper Cherokee.  Since then, I have flown it regularly getting substantial enjoyment out of the experience.  I have found that there are several improvements that can be made to improve my quality of life as a pilot.  As an engineer, I am going to try to create several of these items from scratch so they are customized to my needs.

## Project Organization
There will be multiple projects created.  There will be a miscellaneous project for small odds and ends.  Larger projects will get individual projects.
