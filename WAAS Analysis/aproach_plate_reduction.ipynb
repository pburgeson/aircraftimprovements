    "# Reduction of files\n",
    "Downloaded the individual approach plates from FAA [website](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/dtpp/).  The individual approach plates were used rather than the area pdf's as they were easier to parse.  This notebook removes all plates that are not RNAV approaches."
